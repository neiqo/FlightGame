<p class=\"mw-empty-elt\">\n\n\n\n</p>\n<p><b>Earth</b> is the third planet from
    the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is
    enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System
    sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in
    its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of
    Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental
    landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's
    land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice
    at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes,
    rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly
    moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges,
    volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a
    magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and
    cosmic radiation.\n</p><p>Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains
    Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light
    at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor
    is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the
    planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other
    greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide
    (CO<sub>2</sub>), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and
    water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light.
    This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C,
    at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the
    amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial
    region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and
    ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate
    regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing
    components such as nitrogen to cycle.\n</p><p>Earth is rounded into an
    ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet
    in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most
    massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it,
    taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates
    around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56
    minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the
    perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth
    is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth
    at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as
    Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, and also causes
    tides which gradually slow Earth's rotation. As a result of tidal locking,
    the same side of the Moon always faces Earth.\n</p><p>Earth, like most other
    bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the
    early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the
    ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has
    been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation
    Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and
    have spread across every continent on Earth with the exception of
    Antarctica. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for
    their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment.
    Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable,
    threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and
    causing widespread extinctions.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span
        id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n<p>The Modern English word <span
        id=\"Name\"></span><span id=\"Etymology\"></span> <i>Earth</i>
    developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled
    <i>eorðe</i>. It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their
    ancestral root has been reconstructed as *<i>erþō</i>. In its earliest
    attestation, the word <i>eorðe</i> was used to translate the many senses of
    Latin <i>terra</i> and Greek γῆ <i>gē</i>: the ground, its soil, dry land,
    the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe
    itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a
    personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð
    (\"Earth\"), a giantess often given as the mother of
    Thor.</p><p>Historically, \"earth\" has been written in lowercase. Beginning
    with the use of Early Middle English, its definite sense as \"the globe\"
    was expressed as \"the earth\". By the era of Early Modern English,
    capitalization of nouns began to prevail, and <i>the earth</i> was also
    written <i>the Earth</i>, particularly when referenced along with other
    heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as
    <i>Earth</i>, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though
    \"earth\" and forms with \"the earth\" remain common. House styles now vary:
    Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the
    capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes
    \"Earth\" when appearing as a name, such as a description of the \"Earth's
    atmosphere\", but employs the lowercase when it is preceded by \"the\", such
    as \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase
    in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"</p><p>The
    name <i>Terra</i> <span></span> occasionally is used in scientific writing
    and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet
    from others, while in poetry <i>Tellus</i> <span></span> has been used to
    denote personification of the Earth. <i>Terra</i> is also the name of the
    planet in some Romance languages, languages that evolved from Latin, like
    Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise
    to names with slightly altered spellings, like the Spanish <i>Tierra</i> and
    the French <i>Terre</i>. The Latinate form <i>Gæa</i> or <i>Gaea</i>
    (<span><small>English: </small></span>) of the Greek poetic name <i>Gaia</i>
    (<span title=\"Ancient Greek (to 1453)-language text\"><span
            lang=\"grc\">Γαῖα</span></span>; <span>Ancient Greek:</span> <span
        lang=\"grc-Latn-fonipa\">[ɡâi̯.a]</span> or <span
        lang=\"el-Latn-fonipa\">[ɡâj.ja]</span>) is rare, though the alternative
    spelling <i>Gaia</i> has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which
    case its pronunciation is <span></span> rather than the more classical
    English <span></span>.</p><p>There are a number of adjectives for the planet
    Earth. The word \"earthly\" is derived from \"Earth\". From the Latin
    <i>Terra</i> comes <i>terran</i> <span></span>, <i>terrestrial</i>
    <span></span>, and (via French) <i>terrene</i> <span></span>, and from the
    Latin <i>Tellus</i> comes <i>tellurian</i> <span></span> and
    <i>telluric</i>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Natural_history\">Natural

    System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions
    a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to
    spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of
    that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust
    (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals
    formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely
    taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.</p><p>Estimates of the
    age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger. A leading
    hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from
    Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia,
    collided with Earth. It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass
    merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and <span><span

    href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Earth's atmosphere and
    oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. Water vapor from
    these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from
    asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may
    have been on Earth since it formed. In this model, atmospheric greenhouse
    gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70%
    of its current luminosity. By <span><span

    Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere
    from being stripped away by the solar wind.</p><p>As the molten outer layer
    of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have
    been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more
    felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust.
    The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean
    sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early
    as <span><span data-sort-value=\"7017138853440000000♠\"></span>4.4

            data-sort-value=\"7002140000000000000♠\"></span>140 Ma</span> after
    Earth's formation. There are two main models of how this initial small
    volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance: (1) a
    relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the
    radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid
    growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the
    bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by
    isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary
    rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by
    large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the
    early stages of Earth's history.</p><p>New continental crust forms as a
    result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous
    loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions
    of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group
    together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At
    approximately <span><span
            data-sort-value=\"7016236682000000000♠\"></span>750 Ma</span>, one
    of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The

    and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of
    glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.
    The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered

    this way, Earth's shape is an idealized spheroid – a squashed sphere – with
    a surface area of about 510 million km<sup>2</sup> (197 million sq mi).
    Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar
    Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental
    Eastern and Western hemispheres.\n</p><p>Most of Earth's surface is ocean
    water: 70.8% or 361 million km<sup>2</sup> (139 million sq mi). This vast
    pool of salty water is often called the <i>world ocean</i>, and makes Earth
    with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world or ocean world. Indeed, in
    Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely. The world
    ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian
    Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to
    smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust, but to a lesser extent
    with shelf seas also shelves of the continental crust. The oceanic crust
    forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts,
    submarine volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus,
    and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.\n</p><p>At Earth's polar
    regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea
    ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming
    polar ice caps.\n</p><p>Earth's land covers 29.2%, or 149 million
    km<sup>2</sup> (58 million sq mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface
    includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is
    taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order):
    Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass).
    These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents.
    The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains,
    deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land
    surface varies from a low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a
    maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The
    mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).</p><p>Land
    can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or
    vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation, but ice sheets (10%, not
    including the equally large land under permafrost) or cold as well as hot
    deserts (33%) occupy also considerable amounts of it.\n</p><p>The pedosphere
    is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and
    subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable.
    Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being
    permanent cropland. Earth has an estimated 16.7 million km<sup>2</sup> (6.4
    million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (12.9 million sq
    mi) of pastureland.</p><p>The land surface and the ocean floor form the top
    of Earth's crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's
    lithosphere. Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental
    crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly
    basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials
    such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks. Nearly 75% of the
    continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form
    about 5% of the mass of the crust.</p><p>Earth's surface topography
    comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth's
    land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average
    bathymetric depth of 4 km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea
    level.\n</p><p>Earth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate
    tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and
    erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological
    processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into

    href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Earth's mechanically rigid
    outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided

    plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart;
    and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally.
    Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity,

    wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the

    the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a
    vantage point above the Sun and Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a
    counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are
    not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the
    perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon
    plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this

    orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the

        seasons</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\"
    href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>The axial tilt of Earth is
    approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing
    towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of
    sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of
    the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the
    Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun,
    and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun.
    In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite
    hemisphere.\n</p><p>During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun
    climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days
    shorter. Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no
    daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night
    extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes
    also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all
    day.</p><p>By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by
    the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away
    from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with
    its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently
    occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox
    is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the
    Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter
    solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates
    swapped.</p><p>The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over
    long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight,
    irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years. The orientation (rather
    than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in
    a complete circle over each 25,800-year cycle; this precession is the reason
    for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of
    these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon
    on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across
    Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which
    collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual
    component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler
    wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as
    length-of-day variation.</p><p>In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs
    around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over
    time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical
    patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance
    causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at
    perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted
    toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest
    approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy
    from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect
    is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt,
    and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water
    in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>\n<h2><span

    large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about
    one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative
    to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf
    planet Pluto. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to
    as \"moons\", after Earth's. The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's
    origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the
    collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This
    hypothesis explains the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements
    and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's
    crust.</p><p>The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes
    tides on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking:
    its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a
    result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits
    Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to
    the lunar phases. Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from
    Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year). Over millions of
    years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about
    23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes. During the Ediacaran period, for
    example, (approximately <span><span

    were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.</p><p>The
    Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating
    the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show
    that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.
    Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques
    applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational
    axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions
    of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.</p><p>Viewed
    from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same
    apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these
    two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as
    large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total
    and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.</p><p>On 1 November 2023,
    scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a
    protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a
    collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the
    Moon.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Asteroids_and_artificial_satellites\">Asteroids

    of 361.8 million km<sup>2</sup> (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of
    3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion

    present as ice in ice caps and glaciers. The remaining 30% is ground water,
    1% surface water (covering only 2.8% of Earth's land) and other small forms
    of fresh water deposits such as permafrost, water vapor in the atmosphere,
    biological binding, etc. .</p><p>In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives
    over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice
    eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence
    of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas
    vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes
    the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys
    and other landforms. Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as
    the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of
    climate change.</p><p>The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35
    grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt). Most of this salt was
    released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The
    oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are
    essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an
    important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a
    large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can
    cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation.</p><p>The abundance of water, particularly liquid water, on
    Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets
    in the Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do
    partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for
    stable surface water. Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs
    of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than
    Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers

    Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi), with a scale height of
    about 8.5 km (5.3 mi). A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen,
    20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other
    gaseous molecules. Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% but
    averages about 1%. Clouds cover around two thirds of Earth's surface, more
    so over oceans than land. The height of the troposphere varies with
    latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the
    equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal
    factors.</p><p>Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere.

    enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the
    formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric

    ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric
    functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing
    useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the
    surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is the greenhouse
    effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal
    energy emitted from the surface, thereby raising the average temperature.
    Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the
    primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention
    effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast
    to the current +15 °C (59 °F), and life on Earth probably would not exist in
    its current form.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Weather_and_climate\">Weather and
        climate</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\"
    href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n\n<p>Earth's atmosphere has no
    definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.
    Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km
    (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy
    from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of
    the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler,
    higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the
    weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.</p><p>The
    primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the
    equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes
    between 30° and 60°. Ocean heat content and currents are also important
    factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation
    that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar
    regions.</p><p>Earth receives 1361 W/m<sup>2</sup> of solar irradiance. The
    amount of solar energy that reaches Earth's surface decreases with
    increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface
    at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere.
    As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about
    0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth's surface can
    be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous
    climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the
    tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar
    climates.</p><p>Further factors that affect a location's climates are its
    proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.
    Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due
    to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports
    the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land. Atmospheric circulation also
    plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal
    cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly
    more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land. Finally,
    temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder
    than low-lying areas.</p><p>Water vapor generated through surface
    evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When
    atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water
    condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is
    then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned
    to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism
    for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of
    surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary
    widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a
    millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature
    differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each
    region.</p><p>The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has
    five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental
    and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. The
    Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.
    Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts,
    such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in
    Antarctica.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Upper_atmosphere\">Upper
        atmosphere</span></h3>\n<p>The upper atmosphere, the atmosphere above
    the troposphere, is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and
    thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of
    change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out
    into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar
    wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially
    shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on
    Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is
    a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer
    space.</p><p>Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge
    of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can
    escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the
    atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it
    can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a
    greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space
    contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an
    initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis
    provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as
    hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread
    accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to
    escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that
    developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is
    converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most
    of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper
    atmosphere.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Life_on_Earth\">Life on

    href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Earth is the only known
    place that has ever been habitable for life. Earth's life developed in
    Earth's early bodies of water some hundred million years after Earth
    formed.\n</p><p>Earth's life has been shaping and inhabiting many particular
    ecosystems on Earth and has eventually expanded globally forming an
    overarching biosphere. Therefore, life has impacted Earth, significantly
    altering Earth's atmosphere and surface over long periods of time, causing
    changes like the Great Oxidation Event.</p><p>Earth's life has over time
    greatly diversified, allowing the biosphere to have different biomes, which
    are inhabited by comparatively similar plants and animals. The different
    biomes developed at distinct elevations or water depths, planetary
    temperature latitudes and on land also with different humidity. Earth's
    species diversity and biomass reaches a peak in shallow waters and with
    forests, particularly in equatorial, warm and humid conditions. While
    freezing polar regions and high altitudes, or extremely arid areas are
    relatively barren of plant and animal life.</p><p>Earth provides liquid
    water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and
    interact, and sufficient energy to sustain a metabolism. Plants and other
    organisms take up nutrients from water, soils and the atmosphere. These
    nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.</p><p>Extreme
    weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons),
    occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those
    areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human
    deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides,
    tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts,
    wildfires, and other calamities and disasters. Human impact is felt in many
    areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation
    (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species
    extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion. Human activities
    release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause global warming.
    This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a
    global rise in average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires,
    and migration of species to colder areas.</p>\n<h2><span

    fossil fuels, are only replenished over geological timescales. Large
    deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of
    coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for
    energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore
    bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore
    genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.
    These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which

    that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) warmer than

    developed many views of the planet. The standard astronomical symbols of
    Earth are a quartered circle, <span typeof=\"mw:File\"></span>, representing
    the four corners of the world, and a globus cruciger, <span
        typeof=\"mw:File\"></span>. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity.
    In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility
    deity. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a
    supernatural deity or deities. The Gaia hypothesis, developed in the
    mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single
    self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of
    habitability.</p><p>Images of Earth taken from space, particularly during
    the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people
    viewed the planet that they lived on, called the overview effect,
    emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility. In particular,
    this caused a realization of the scope of effects from human activity on
    Earth's environment. Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation,
    humans have started to take action on environmental issues globally,
    acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of Earth's
    environments.\n</p><p>Scientific investigation has resulted in several
    culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial
    belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea
    of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers
    Pythagoras and Parmenides. Earth was generally believed to be the center of
    the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it
    was a moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.</p><p>It was
    only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at
    least many millions of years. Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate
    the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864,
    sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity
    and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th
    centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was
    established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.</p>\n<h2><span
