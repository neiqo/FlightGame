# Project Name: SolarQuest

Our idea is to create a gamified learning experience about our solar system where the player starts on a planet and must answer questions to gain fuel for their rocket. Each correct answer gives them more fuel which enables them to travel to the next planet. Players win by going to each planet in the solar system and finally leaving the solar system. The players gather knowledge to answer the questions by exploring the planet they are currently on. There will be a leaderboard after the players complete the quiz that shows who has the highest correct answers.
